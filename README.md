# PingOne integration to AWS Lake

PingOne Integration to AWS Lake

Enable PingOne event log integration to AWS Lake

Moose Overview
Moose is a data lake for security logs, built in the customerâ€™s account. The data lake is backed by an S3 bucket, and organizes data as a set of Lake Formation tables. Moose is designed to optimize the cost of storing and querying massive security log sources, while maintaining good query performance and compatibility with a wide variety of analytic infrastructure. Moose
customers retain low-level ownership of their data. Moose also delivers a set of core AWS-native security logs, minimizing costs and maximizing performance.



Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)
Core to the Moose mission is simplifying the storage, retrieval, and consumption of security logs through application of a common schema. The Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) is a collaborative open-source effort between AWS and partners. OCSF includes syntax and semantics for common security log events, defines versioning criteria to facilitate schema evolution, and includes a self-governance process to be maximally inclusive of security log producers and consumers. OCSF source code is homed on Github, and is released under the Apache License version 2.0.

Requirements
PingOne Tenant
AWS Lambda Function [https://github.com/pingone-davinci/pingone-aws-lake]
AWS S3 (Two Buckets) 

Before you begin
In AWS:
Create two S3 buckets to store the OCSF events, for example:
Temporary (JSON): pingone-aws-lake-demo-ocsf
Output (Parquet): pingone-aws-lake-demo-parquet
Create new AWS Lambda function
Select Node.js 16.x as the runtime
Configure the runtime to have 512MB of memory and 1 minute timeout
Download the index.js and package.json from https://github.com/pingone-davinci/pingone-aws-lake and create a zip deployment package as per the AWS Lambda documentation here (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-package.html)


Steps
Configure AWS Lambda Environment Variables

Create the following required Environment Variable under Lambda > Functions > Configuration > Environment Variables with the following details:

ACCOUNT_ID: The AWS Account associated with PingOne events
PASSWORD: The PingOne Webhook basic authentication password
REGION: The AWS Region of the Lambda
S3_BUCKET_OCSF:  The name of the S3 bucket created to store the temporary OCSF events
S3_BUCKET_PARQUET:  The name of the S3 bucket created to store the final parquet event files
SOURCE_LOCATION:  Is the location provided by AWS Lake when registering the custom source
USERNAME: The PingOne Webhook basic authentication username








Create a Function URL under Lambda > Functions > Configuration > Function URL with the following details:
Auth type: NONE
Configure PingOne Webhooks

Create a Webhook from Connections > Webhooks with the following details: 
Name: Ping Moose Webhook
Destination URL: Your AWS Lambda Function URL
For example: https://kgymdwz52ijsjjrh2u2fck2ksq0yosxg.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/
Format: Ping Activity Format (JSON)
Headers: Basic Authentication 
Enter the username and password selected above in the AWS Lambda configuration


Event Types: 
Flow Completed
Flow Updated
Password Recovery
Password Reset
User Created
User Deleted
User Updated



Finally, click Save. 


Summary

After the configuration has been completed, PingOne authentication, password resets, user create, update and deletes events will be created in Parquet format in the S3 bucket configured in the AWS Lambda.
